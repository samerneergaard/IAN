# Jesture
Jesture is a fun, group charade game that is intended for small or large groups of people of all ages.
The user will be prompted to enter the names of their group whom they intend to play with.
Next, they will choose a game mode of their desire.
The name that pops up on the screen is the first player to start.
The first player will place the phone up to their forehead when ready, and then try to guess what the term is from their teammates acting out the term.
The player will then tilt the phone up for pass and down for correct.
After the timer runs out the player's score is displayed on the phone and they will be prompted to move on to the next player or start a new game.
